Doony is a series of UI improvements on top of Jenkins. Install this to make
your Jenkins user experience much better.

Don't have admin access to your Jenkins instance? You can install it as
a [Chrome extension](#chrome-extension)

#### Good news!

As of Jenkins version 1.570, some themes from Doony are getting merged back
into the main project. Doony version **2.0** works with these updated themes.

- If you are installing Doony on a Jenkins version **older** than 1.570, use
  Doony version 1.6 (`git checkout 1.6`, in this repo)

- If you are installing Doony on a Jenkins version **newer** than 1.570, use
  the master version.

## Who's Using It

Doony was made at [Twilio]( https://www.twilio.com ). It's also been forked/starred by
employees at:

- Panic, Inc
- the BBC
- Instagram
- Netflix
- eBay
- Groupon
- Mail.ru

## Changes

- There's a "Build Now" button on every build page. The button will redirect
  you to the console output of the new build. You can also easily cancel the
  current build.
- The orbs are gone! Replaced with shiny circles and circular in-progress bars.
- Click targets in the left hand menu are much bigger (they expand to fill the
  available UI)
- The fonts are bigger. Way bigger.
- "Jenkins" logo replaced with a custom color and the domain of your build server
- More spacing in between list items.
- Removes a lot of the useless icons
- "Console Output" looks more like a console.
- Replaces Courier New with Consolas.
- Hover menus have a pointer cursor, indicating clickability
- Text inputs are friendlier, bigger
- Builds are zebra-striped, have more padding
- Homepage has an option for "view console output of latest test"

### Chrome Extension

If you don't control your Jenkins environment, you can run this as a Chrome
extension.

1. Clone this repo locally.

2. Edit the `matches` value of the `manifest.json` file to contain the server
names of your Jenkins servers (see [Match Patterns][patterns]).

2. Run `git update-index --skip-worktree manifest.json` so you don't
   accidentally commit your `manifest.json` change.

3. Open [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions). Check "Developer mode" if it's not already. Click "Load unpacked extension".

4. Navigate to this repo and click "Open"

## Installation in Jenkins

If you do install your Jenkins environment it's probably best to embed it in
the default Jenkins styles.

1. Install the [JQuery Plugin][jquery]

2. Install the ["Simple Theme" Plugin][simple]

3. In Jenkins, click "Manage Jenkins", then "Configure System", then specify
   the CSS and Javascript URL's for this theme. You should find a place to host
   these, on a static server inside your cluster.

    You can use these URLs:

        # Or 2.1, depending on which version of Jenkins you are running.
        - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/doony/1.6/css/doony.min.css
        - https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/doony/1.6/js/doony.min.js

    Alternatively you can let Jenkins self host these files by putting them in `~/.jenkins/userContent`
    With the default Jenkins settings the files you use will then be:

        - http://localhost:8080/userContent/doony.css
        - http://localhost:8080/userContent/doony.js

    Here's a screenshot of the settings page:

[simple]: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Simple+Theme+Plugin

4. Click "Save". Enjoy!

## Compatibility

This will "work" against the latest version of Jenkins, currently 1.532. It may
work with older versions but this is not guaranteed.

## Notes

- This is very much a work in progress, feel free to file bugs/issues and I'll
make improvements as I can.

- This project is in no way intended to slam Jenkins developers. Jenkins is
awesome, and unlike Travis you never get a blank screen. They are working
within a series of vastly different constraints than I am. Consider:

    - they have to support every browser/platform/language
    - any change they make will make part of the userbase angry
    - every change has to be completely open-source friendly in every way
